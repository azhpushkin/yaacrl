# yaacrl

This is a Shazam-like library, aimed to recognize the audiotracks.
Contains logic for both fingerprinting and storage (storage is done via sqlite).

**NOTE**: I use this projects as a playground, so there are 
quirks here and there. For instance, there is neither configuration of Storage
for fingerprints nor any guarantees of persistense about those, as for now.
